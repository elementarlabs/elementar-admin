      Advancing to the 1960s, Lorem Ipsum was made popular by typeface manufacturer Letraset,
      who used it in their advertising campaigns. Letraset offered pages of Lorem Ipsum as rub down
      transfer sheets, which were widely used in the pre-computer era for layouts.
      These transfer pages, known as Letraset Body Type, were featured in the company's advertising and their popular catalogue.
